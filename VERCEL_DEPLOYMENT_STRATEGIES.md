## Git-Based Deployment (Primary Workflow)

Git-based deployment is the recommended primary workflow for most development scenarios.

### How It Works
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Vercel automatically builds and deploys:
   - Production branch (main) → Production environment
   - Other branches → Preview environments
   - Pull requests → Preview environments with PR comments

### Setup
- Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
- Configure branch deployments in project settings
- Set up environment variables if needed

### Commands
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature"

# Push to GitHub to trigger deployment
git push -u origin feature-name

# Merge to main when ready (via GitHub or locally)
git checkout main
git merge feature-name
git push origin main
```

### Best For
- Production deployments
- Team collaboration
- Long-term project maintenance
- Feature development
- Maintaining version history

## Direct Vercel Previews (Supplementary Tool)

Direct Vercel previews allow for rapid iteration and testing without affecting your Git history.

### How It Works
1. Use Vercel CLI to deploy your local code directly
2. Get a unique preview URL instantly
3. Changes are not connected to your Git repository

### Setup
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Link your project (first time only)
vercel link
```

### Commands
```bash
# Create a preview from current directory
vercel

# Create a preview with custom settings
vercel --env KEY=value

# Create a production build
vercel --prod
```

### Best For
- Design tweaks and experiments
- Quick visual feedback
- Client demos of work-in-progress
- Troubleshooting deployment issues
- Sharing progress without committing

## Hybrid Approach Best Practices

### When to Use Git-Based Deployments
- For all meaningful code changes
- When you want to track history
- For changes that should be reviewed
- For production deployments
- When working with a team

### When to Use Direct Previews
- When iterating on design/UI
- To quickly test a fix before committing
- To share a work-in-progress with clients
- When troubleshooting deployment-specific issues
- For experiments you may discard

### Development Cycle Integration
1. **Plan**: Define feature requirements
2. **Explore**: Use direct previews for rapid prototyping
3. **Implement**: Develop in Git with branch deployments
4. **Review**: Use PR previews for formal review
5. **Deploy**: Merge to main for production deployment
6. **Troubleshoot**: Use direct previews if production issues arise

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development Workflow
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b new-feature`
2. Develop the core functionality
3. Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin new-feature`
4. Review the automatic preview deployment
5. Create a PR for structured review
6. Merge to main when ready

### Design Iteration Workflow
1. Make UI changes locally
2. Deploy directly for quick feedback: `vercel`
3. Iterate on design based on preview
4. Once satisfied, commit changes to Git
5. Push to GitHub for formal deployment

### Troubleshooting Workflow
1. Identify an issue in production
2. Create a fix locally
3. Test with direct preview: `vercel`
4. Verify the fix works in the preview environment
5. Commit and push to Git once confirmed
6. Deploy to production via Git

## Command Reference

### Git Commands
```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Message"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push -u origin branch-name

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge branch-name
git push origin main
```

### Vercel CLI Commands
```bash
# Install CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Link project
vercel link

# Create preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# List deployments
vercel ls

# Remove deployment
vercel remove [deployment-url]
```

## Conclusion

By combining Git-based deployments with direct Vercel previews, you can maintain the robustness of version control while gaining the flexibility of rapid iteration. Use Git as your source of truth and direct previews as a supplementary tool for specific scenarios.

Remember that all production code should eventually flow through Git, even if you use direct previews during development.
